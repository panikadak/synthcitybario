# SynthCity - An Infinite Procedural Cyberpunk City

SynthCity is an interactive WebGL experience built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). Journey through an endless neon-lit cyberpunk city while enjoying a curated synthwave playlist.

## Story

In a city pulsing with neon, beneath purple skies, endless streets stretch toward the unknown...

You're in the driver's seat of a hovercar. First-person view, autopilot engaged, but the control is yours. Skyscrapers flicker with holograms stretching forever. Ads, warnings, and ghosts of the past dance between them as shadows move... Watching. Waiting.

Synthwave beats pulse through the speakers while the city moves with the rhythm. The engine growls, restless.

You came here for a reason. Maybe to escape. Maybe to find something. Maybe just to drive... Until the world stops making sense.

No maps. No rules. No turning back.

Just you, the machine, and the road ahead.
